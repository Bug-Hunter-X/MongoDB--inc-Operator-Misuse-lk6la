# MongoDB $inc Operator Misuse
This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB.  The `$inc` operator is designed to increment or decrement a numerical value within a document.  An incorrect use of the operator (e.g., incrementing when you should decrement or vice-versa) can lead to incorrect data and unexpected results. 
The solution provides the correct implementation to demonstrate the proper use of the `$inc` operator.
